The `lines` trio is here because GL's own `linewidth` is silently clamped to 1
by essentially every desktop driver. At a device pixel ratio of 2 that is half a
CSS pixel, which reads as grey mush rather than a crisp line. LineMaterial draws
strokes as camera-facing quads instead, so widths are real. It does have to be
told the canvas size: set `material.resolution` on every resize or the widths go
wrong.

(RoomEnvironment was vendored for image based lighting and then removed when the
picker became an unlit wireframe. Nothing is shaded any more.)

## One local patch, applied to each vendored file

`OrbitControls.js`, `BufferGeometryUtils.js` and the three `lines` files each
ship with a bare import:

    } from 'three';

Bare specifiers need an import map, and import maps only reached Safari in 16.4.
This site has to work on older phones, so the line is repointed instead:

    } from './three.module.js';

**If you upgrade three.js, reapply this.** Without it the picker silently falls
back to its checkbox list and nobody notices the 3D view is gone.
