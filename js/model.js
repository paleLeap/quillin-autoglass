/* Procedural vehicle archetypes.

   WHY GENERATED AND NOT DOWNLOADED
   The hard requirement of this step is that every piece of glass is its own
   named, separately pickable mesh, positioned correctly for the body style.
   A downloaded car model gives you a nice car and exactly the wrong thing:
   its glass is usually one merged mesh, or baked into the body, and splitting
   it into thirteen correctly identified panels is manual work that has to be
   redone from scratch every time a model is swapped. Generating the geometry
   makes the panel names true by construction, costs no licensing, and keeps
   all eight archetypes in one visual language.

   COORDINATES
   x  length, +x is the front of the vehicle, centred on 0
   y  height, 0 is the ground
   z  width,  +z is the DRIVER side (US market, driver on the left)

   AUTHORING
   Profiles are written in normalised units so one table describes every body
   style. `u` runs 0 at the front bumper to 1 at the rear bumper. `y` is a
   fraction of overall height. Everything is scaled to metres at build time.

   Silhouettes are corner-rounded rather than drawn as straight polygons: every
   vertex becomes a quadratic arc whose radius is `round`, which is what stops
   these reading as boxes. Profiles carry more vertices than strictly needed so
   those arcs have something to follow. */
